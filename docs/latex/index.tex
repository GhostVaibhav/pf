This is a static library for fast particle filtering. Abstract base classes for different particle filters are provided (e.\+g. the Bootstrap Filter, the Auxiliary Particle Filter, Rao-\/\+Blackwellized particle filter, etc.), as well as non-\/abstract base classes for closed form filtering algorithms (e.\+g. Kalman Filter, Hidden Markov Model filter, etc.). i\+Most (all?) of these classes are templated for speed. Once you have a certain model in mind, make it into a class and inherit from an appropriate particle filter.

\subsection*{Installation}

You must build this yourself. Make sure to compile with C++11 enabled ({\ttfamily -\/std=c++11}), and to include the {\ttfamily include} directory. Note, also, that this code all makes use of the \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/}{\tt Eigen library}.
